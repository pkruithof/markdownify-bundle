# NOTE: This project is deprecated and will be archived!

When Symfony was in version 2 (and later 3) this bundle made a lot more sense 
than it does now. With the introduction of Symfony 4, bundles become less and
less important. Furthermore, this bundle mainly adds a service, which you can
easily configure in your Symfony application. You don't need a bundle for that.

For these reasons, the project is deprecated and will be archived in some time.
If you are using this, please consider removing it and configure the service 
like this:

```yaml
services:
  markdownify:
    class: Markdownify\ConverterExtra
    arguments: [] # optionally specify some arguments    
```


# Original readme:

Provides Symfony integration for the Markdownify/Markdownify_Extra scripts.

The original Markdownify from [Milian Wolff](http://milianw.de/projects/markdownify/)
has been refactored by myself (see [modifications](#modifications))
and later by [Pixel418](https://github.com/Pixel418/Markdownify).

The latter is now merged back into this bundle as a dependency, so that the
ongoing development in that repo is also available in this bundle.

## Requirements
The bundle is built for Symfony 2.7 and up. It should work on older versions,
but they are not supported.

## Installation

```
php composer.phar require "pk/markdownify-bundle:^4.0"
```

### AppKernel.php

Add to `app/AppKernel.php`:
```php
new PK\MarkdownifyBundle\PKMarkdownifyBundle()
```

### Configuration

The configuration is optional as all options have defaults.

```yaml
pk_markdownify:
  # Where to put the link references:
  # * 0 for after the content (default)
  # * 1 for after each paragraph
  # * 2 for in the paragraph, directly after the link text
  link_position: 0

  # When larger than the minimal width (25), the body will be
  # wrapped to this width. Set to false to disable wrapping (default)
  body_width: false

  # Whether to keep html tags which cannot be converted to markdown
  keep_html: false
```

## Usage
The bundle registers a `markdownify` service. Use it as you would use the Markdownify class:

```php
$converter = $container->get('markdownify');
$converter->parseString('<h1>Heading</h1>');
// Returns: # Heading
```

**NOTE**: Before version 3.0, the Markdownify classes were included in this bundle,
which had a different namespace than the `\Markdownify` one used currently. If you use
this namespace somewhere in your code, be sure to update them when upgrading to 3.0.


## Modifications
The following modifications have been applied to the original Markdownify code.

* PSR 0 to 2 coding standards fix
* Organised properties and methods (properties first, then methods)
